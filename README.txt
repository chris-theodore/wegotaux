Milestone 3: 
Kenny: During this milestone, I worked with the group to make progress on the back end.  We had many meetings to move forward and get on the same page.  These meetings were productive and I tried to take the lead on keeping notes.  There were multiple problems with the environment during the past couple weeks.  When we had to switch the git website we were using, I went to office hours to clarify an issue, as well as create a cheat sheet for git commands.  I think this knowledge helped the team as a whole.  Finally, my environment with XAMPP was giving me trouble.  Despite me working with the team to try and fix, as well as going to office hours, the problem could not be fixed.  I wrote drafts of database sql calls, but they are untested.  Going forward I am going to be helping more with the front end.  


Milestone 2: 

Ezra: This week, I worked on setting up the React file for our project and populating everything in Git to lay the foundation for the project. I also connected our app with the Spotify developers tool so that we can begin using their preexisting APIs. In addition, I paired up with Chris to begin sketching out the frontend design and components. 

Chris: This week, I worked on creating our Git Repo for the team, as well as organizing team meetings. Aside from administrative tasks, I began working on mock-ups for frontend design ideas with Ezra. We started working together on Figma to create possible layouts for how we envision the app working on the frontend and paired it with notes that we can consider when working with the backend team as well as the frontend code.

Clara/Preston/Kenny: This week we worked as a group on the backend database setup for our project. We created an E/R diagram, translated it into schema, and implemented in SQL. In the process of creating the SQL script, we discussed and documented many constraints and edge cases. Specifically, Preston and Clara worked on writing the SQL script while Kenny wrote the proposal.
