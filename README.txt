Ezra: This week, I worked on setting up the React file for our project and populating everything in Git to lay the foundation for the project. I also connected our app with the Spotify developers tool so that we can begin using their preexisting APIs. In addition, I paired up with Chris to begin sketching out the frontend design and components. 

Clara/Preston/Kenny: This week we worked as a group on the backend database setup for our project. We created an E/R diagram. translated it into schema, and implemented in SQL. In the process of creating the SQL script, we discussed and documented many constraints and edge cases. Specifically, Preston and Clara worked on writing the SQL script while Kenny wrote the proposal.
